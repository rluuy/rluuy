Sup :)

I'm a grad student at USC and I'm interested in AI and NLP. In particular, I'm looking to delve into Japanese and English translation research. However, my background is pretty mutli-discplinary so I'm always interested in getting involved in all sorts of cool projects.

This is a space where I have a variety of side projects that I'll tinker around with in my spare time.
